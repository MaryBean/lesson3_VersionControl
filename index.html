            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control remembers the changes made to a file for future reference. It’s a system that keeps track of these changes. Version control systems maintain a version of the files in their original state in case of an emergency. In a way, version control systems act like a glorified thumb drive for web designers and web developers. Furthermore, version control systems are often very inexpensive, which makes them excellent as a failsafe for holding onto previous work. Local Version Control systems are databases that keep all of the files currently under revision. Centralized Version Control Systems allow developers to collaborate with one another simultaneously on the same file. Distributed Version Control Systems act as a complete  clone of all the data stored within a file, they act as a mirror instead of a snapshot of the information stored.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Much like the insult adored throughout Britain, Git has a history as fiery as Ron Weasley’s hair. Before the era of free repositories dawned upon the internet, we were reduced to Linux kernals. This open source software required frequent maintenance, and updates which were stored as either patches or files. Proprietary Distributed Version Control Systems called BitKeeper began to be used in 2002 by the Linux kernel to automatically save the updated files. Alas the partnership between Linux kernel and BitKeeper was not meant to last. BitKeeper’s free-of-charge status was revoked and the relationship between the companies broke down. The Linux developers came together and devised a new version control system for themselves, and thus GitHub was born. Github was fast, had a simple design, it was fully distributed, and able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently. In short, it worked like magic.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Data stored in Github is a bit like opening up your phone and discovering that your friend has taken 50 photographs of your dog. In short, it takes snapshots of all of your files. Every time you save your project, github takes a snapshot of what that information looks like at the time and stores that snapshot in a miniature database. Github is far more than a simple version control system. Because it takes snapshots of the information, this allows Github to have more versatility and more tools available to it’s users. Internet connection isn’t mandatory for many parts of Github, because when you want to see the history of your project Github simply reads the file directly from your local database. It does not need a server to find the history of the project to display it.

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two main approaches to creating a Git project. You can either clone an existing Git repository, or import an existing project into Git. To initialize a repository in an existing directory on a Mac computer, enter the code: ”$cd /Users/user/your_repository”. 
A new subdirectory called .git has all of the necessary repository files. To find a copy of an existing Git repository use a git clone. A “git clone” brings up every version for every file for the history of the project. To clone a repository, enter “git clone [url]”.This creates a directory named “libgit2”, and initializes a git directory inside of it.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in your working directory exists in two different states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files located in the last snapshot recorded by Git. Untracked files are any other file. All files are tracked after Git firsts clones a repository because nothing has been edited yet. The amount of untracked files in the repository will increase as files are added and edited over time. To check the status of your files, use the git status command. If the terminal returns this: “Your branch is up-to-date with ‘origin/master’. Nothing to commit, working directory clean” This means that none of the tracked files are modified.
