## Project Description:
This assignment helped to teach me how to set up a repository using github.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that version control systems are used by developers to preserve old files.
2. I learned about the history of Github, that the end of a business relationship between Linux and BitKeeper caused Linux to create a faster user friendly version control system they called Github.
3. I learned that files in the working directory are either tracked or untracked, remembered while being edited, or stored securely within the repository.
